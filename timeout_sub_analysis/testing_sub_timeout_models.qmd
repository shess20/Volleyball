Ho: model without timeout and subs is sufficent 
Ha: the model with timeout and subs is better 
```{r}
# Log-likelihood for the full model (Model 1)
loglik_full_model_subs<- -result_full_with_timeout_and_sub$value  # Negate the result since your function returns negative log-likelihood

# Log-likelihood for the independent model
loglik_model_full <- -result$value  # Negate the result since your function returns negative log-likelihood

# Degrees of freedom difference (difference in the number of parameters)
df_difference <- 1  # Independent model has 1 parameter (probability of an ace event)

# Likelihood ratio test statistic
LR_statistic <- 2 * (loglik_full_model_subs - loglik_model_full)

# p-value
p_value <- pchisq(LR_statistic, df_difference, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Print the results
cat("Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic (Full Model vs. Independent Model):", LR_statistic, "\n")
cat("Degrees of Freedom Difference:", df_difference, "\n")
cat("p-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Conclusion
if (p_value < 0.05) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. The model with subs and timeouts is signifficantly better.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. The model without timeouts and subs is sufficient.\n")
}
```

Ho: independent model is sufficient 
Ha: the full model is significantly better than the independent model 
```{r}

# Degrees of freedom difference (difference in the number of parameters)
df_difference <- 1  # Independent model has 1 parameter (probability of an ace event)

# Likelihood ratio test statistic
